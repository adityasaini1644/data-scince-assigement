    "Skewed data can affect the interpretation of statistical analyses, and may require special methods of analysis to account for the asymmetry. For example, when the data is positively skewed, the mean may not be a representative measure of central tendency, and the median may be a better choice. Skewed data can also affect the calculation of the standard deviation and other measures of variability. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the skewness of the data and take it into account when interpreting the results of data analysis."
