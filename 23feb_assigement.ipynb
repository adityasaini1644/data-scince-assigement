    "Pandas DataFrame provides a wide range of functions for manipulating and transforming data. Some of the common functions that are used to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame are:\n",

    "head() and tail(): These functions are used to display the first and last few rows of the DataFrame, respectively. These functions are useful to quickly inspect the data and get a sense of its structure and content.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "sort_values(): This function is used to sort the DataFrame by one or more columns. This function is useful to reorder the data and to identify patterns and trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "groupby(): This function is used to group the DataFrame by one or more columns and apply a function to each group. This function is useful to aggregate the data and to compute summary statistics for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "pivot_table(): This function is used to create a pivot table from the DataFrame, which is a summary table that shows the relationship between two or more columns. This function is useful to summarize and analyze complex data and to identify patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "fillna(): This function is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or method. This function is useful to handle missing data and to avoid errors when performing calculations or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "apply(): This function is used to apply a function to each element, row, or column of the DataFrame. This function is useful to transform the data and to perform custom calculations or analysis.\n",
